Metroid: Samus Returns takes place immediately after the events of the first game. The Space Pirates, helmed by Mother Brain, have been defeated and their nefarious plans to use creatures called Metroids as an unlimited power source have been mostly thwarted.

Step two for the United Federation: Ensure that no one will ever be able to use these Metroids again. To that end, the organization sends resident bounty hunter badass Samus Aran to the home planet of the Metroids to straight-up murder every last one. Yes, itâ€™s a classic story of heroic genocide!
