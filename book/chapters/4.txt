The story lines up pretty much exactly with that of the original Game Boy game, and is told with an animated cutscene at the outset, followed by zero dialogue throughout the rest of the game. If youâ€™ve been put off by the remarkable amount of backstory in later Metroid entries, worry not. This is silent Samus at her very best. The peaceful simplicity of the early Metroid games really works in their favor, and Samus Returns is no exception.
