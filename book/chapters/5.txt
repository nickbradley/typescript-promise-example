Your quest of hunting down the Metroids predictably involves exploration, gear gathering and laser blasting. And even though the map is completely different (and much larger) than the one in the original Metroid 2, the objective is the same: You’ll enter a new area and soon discover an altar that is asking for the DNA from X number of Metroids. Once you collect that Metroid DNA, you return to the altar; then, some poison goo lowers, and you’re able to explore deeper into the planet, where more Metroids await.

This sounds redundant on paper, but is far more interesting in practice. For one thing, the combat in Samus Returns is fantastic. 2D Metroid games have always struggled with control limitations. Simple problems, like only being able to fire in eight directions, made certain encounters frustrating. Even small, puny enemies were a pain because you’d have to line Samus up perfectly to make a shot.
