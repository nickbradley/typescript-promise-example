This combination plays into fights with all enemies, big and small. For smaller foes, countering will let you one-shot them, progressing through areas without taking any damage so long as youâ€™re careful. Larger enemies can be countered as well. In boss fights, countering often yields a cutscene with Samus flying through the air, landing on the head of the beastie before unleashing rockets aplenty. This makes the combat in Samus Returns feel more like an action game and less like a geometric problem.
