The combat is best on display during the game’s many boss fights. Effectively there are more than 40 of them, as each Metroid you hunt down is like a miniboss in and of itself. Early Metroids are pretty simple, going down with a counterattack and a few rockets. But the Metroids quickly evolve, eventually presenting complex, multi-stage battles with challenging attack patterns to memorize. Toward the end of the game there’s one fight in particular that is one of the most challenging in the history of Metroid, even on normal difficulty. And thanks to the combat enhancements, these battles never feel like a chore. It’s the pinnacle of 2D combat in a franchise that has always suffered on that front.

Visuals have never been an area where Metroid has struggled, though. Each entry has pushed its hardware to the limits, and Samus Returns continues that tradition. The game’s graphics are in full 3D, albeit locked to a side-scrolling perspective, and the level of detail in each of the environments is remarkable. The Metroid home planet is quite varied, from plant-ridden caves to lava pools to technological wonders deep beneath the surface. If you can stomach the 3DS’s 3D effects, they’re a serious treat here. The sense of depth in these environments is perfect. Even on older 3DS handhelds, the level of detail pours through the screen in buckets.
